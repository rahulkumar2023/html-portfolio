    <h2>About Me</h2>
<hr/>

<p>Hi, I am a Computer science student at Queenâ€™s University! I have a passion for data analysis. I love analyzing data in my day-to-day life to make decisions and I believe that a business can perform much better if they drive decisions based on data points. I have analyzed sport-related datasets to combine my 2 passions, sports and analytics together. </p>
